## What You'll Learn 📚

This repository covers three key areas of GitHub Copilot customization:

🎯 **Custom Instructions** - Personalize how Copilot interacts with your code  
💬 **Reusable Prompts** - Create and save prompts for common tasks  
🤖 **Custom Chat Modes** - Build specialized chat experiences for your workflow  

## Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

Before diving in, you'll need to install the **GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** to enable enhanced Copilot functionality.

#### Installing GitHub MCP Server

1. **Install via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @github/github-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Or install via pip:**
   ```bash
   pip install github-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Configure your MCP client** to connect to the GitHub MCP server. The server provides enhanced context about your GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

4. **Authentication:** You'll need a GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions. Set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
